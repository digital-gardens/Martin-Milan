# How to Print a Long Conversation from Microsoft Copilot

My dad, who is nearly 80, wanted to print a conversation from Copilot, but it was too long. He asked me to help him with it.

First I tried to print from Microsoft Copilot directly, but the print preview showed only ...  EDIT: the lanscape mode showed only the last part of the conversation, and the portrait mode was even worse.

Then I suggested he could copy the conversation and paste it into a Word document, but he didn't know how to do that.

I explained that he could select the text in Copilot, right-click to copy it, then open Word and paste it there.

He was able to do that, but he still had trouble printing it because 

a. Paste looked weird in Word, and
b. Paste-Special was in monotype font.	

I showed him how to change the font in Word to something more readable, like Segoe UI.

Are there some other, easier ways to print a long conversation from Copilot?

Would switching to Copilot Pro help with this?

Here are some options to consider that might make printing easier without having to switch to Copilot Pro:

1. **Use Your Browser's Built-In Print Features:**  
   Many modern browsers offer a “Print to PDF” option. Instead of printing directly, try printing to a PDF from the browser. Adjusting settings such as margins, scaling, and orientation (portrait vs. landscape) can sometimes allow you to capture the entire conversation without it being cut off. You might also experiment with the "Selection" print option if available, though that’s hit-or-miss with long, scrolling pages.

2. **Leverage Reader Mode or Web Capture:**  EDIT: no reader mode, TODO: research some browser extensions 
   If you’re using a browser like Microsoft Edge or Firefox, switching to reader mode can simplify the display of the conversation. Reader mode strips out extraneous formatting, often resulting in a more printer-friendly layout. In Edge, you can also use the “Web capture” feature (or a full-page screenshot extension) that lets you capture the entire page and then print the saved image or PDF. This way, you bypass copy-paste quirks in Word entirely.

3. **Export as HTML and Open With Word or Another Editor:**  EDIT: BLANK Page
   Instead of copying and pasting, try saving the Copilot conversation page as an HTML document (usually via “Save page as” in your browser). When you open the HTML file in Word, your document may retain more of the original layout, reducing the formatting headaches. Once loaded, you can adjust styles within Word as needed.

4. **Use a Dedicated Screenshot or Web-Capture Tool:**  
   There are tools and browser extensions designed specifically for capturing long web pages (for example, “Full Page Screen Capture”). While this method creates an image rather than text, it can be useful if preserving the exact layout is crucial. Just be cautious about resolution and readability when printed.

Concerning **Copilot Pro**—upgrading generally brings enhanced features and a more robust interface, but printing issues like these are more about the medium (the browser and Word’s handling of pasted content) rather than the Copilot version itself. Unless Microsoft explicitly adds an “export conversation” or “print conversation” feature in Pro (and as of now there’s no indication that printing long conversations is one of them), switching to Pro won’t necessarily resolve the formatting challenges you and your dad encountered.

Depending on the level of technical ease you’re after, trying the browser-based PDF export or using reader mode might be your best bet to get a neatly formatted, printable version of your conversation—all without dealing with Word’s font or paste formatting issues.

It might also be worth exploring if your browser has updated tools or extensions to automatically reformat long web pages for printing, which could make this process even smoother for your dad. Would you like ideas for any specific browser extensions or additional tips for tweaking print settings?
