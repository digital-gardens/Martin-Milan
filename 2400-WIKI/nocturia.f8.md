Nocturia is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as "the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times for voiding (i.e., to urinate)".[1] The term is derived from Latin nox – "night", and Greek [τα] ούρα – "urine". Causes are varied and can be difficult to discern.[2] Although not every patient needs treatment, most people seek treatment for severe nocturia, waking up to void more than 2 or 3 times per night.
