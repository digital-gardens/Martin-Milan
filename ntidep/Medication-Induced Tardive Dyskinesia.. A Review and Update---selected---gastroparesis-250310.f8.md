Medication-Induced Tardive Dyskinesia.. A Review and Update.md

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that causes involuntary, repetitive body movements and is commonly seen in patients who are on long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications. However, several other classes of medications with different mechanisms are also associated with TD.




We conducted a PubMed search using keywords and combined word searches that involved medication-induced TD as well as agents that are associated with causing or are used to treat medication-induced TD. We attempted to include as many recent (publication date of 2015 and later) articles as possible. The search terms we used to gather this information included tardive dyskinesia, medication-induced tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, antiemetics, anticholinergics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antiparkinson agents, stimulants, anxiolytics, biogenic amines, mood stabilizers, oral contraceptives, incidence, prevalence, dopamine, oxidative stress, pharmacokinetic, genetic polymorphisms, gastroparesis, history, case study, epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment. In this review based on our literature search, we discuss the pathophysiology and epidemiology of TD, medications that can induce TD, possible solutions for preventing TD, and treatments for managing TD and for managing TD symptoms while a patient is concurrently taking an APD.



Antiemetics are prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux and include dopamine antagonists, serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 antagonists, antihistamines, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, has a strong correlation with the occurrence of TD.56 Old age, female sex, history of diabetes mellitus, and taking metoclopramide for 12+ weeks are risk factors for developing metoclopramide-induced TD. Metoclopramide is associated with respiratory dyskinesia and can manifest in TD as gasping, abnormal breathing, and irregular esophageal movements.56 Tapering metoclopramide has not been shown to decrease the risk of respiratory dyskinesia, and individuals with alterations in the CYP2D6 gene have decreased ability to metabolize metoclopramide and are more at risk for developing TD symptoms.57 Metoclopramide is currently the only medication that is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat gastroparesis, so options for preventing the onset or worsening of metoclopramide-induced TD in a patient with gastroparesis are lacking.57
