Branched-Chain Amino Acids.
Some evidence suggests that an inability to clear ingested forms of the amino acid phenylalanine is associated with TD. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are reported to decrease TD symptoms123 because they decrease plasma phenylalanine by stimulating protein synthesis and insulin release.124 BCAAs also decrease the accumulation of tyrosine, another amino acid and an important precursor to dopamine, that reduces overall dopamine synthesis in the nervous system.124 Most important, BCAAs also seem to be effective at decreasing TD symptoms while an APD medication is still on board or the patient has a history of APD exposure.123 BCAAs are available over the counter in a flavored powder preparation to mix with water, so they may be a promising, practical, and inexpensive treatment for TD.
