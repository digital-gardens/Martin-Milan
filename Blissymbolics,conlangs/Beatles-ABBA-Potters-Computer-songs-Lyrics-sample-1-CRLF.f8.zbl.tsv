The Beatles Lyrics




"Do You Want To Know A Secret"

You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you







"A Hard Day's Night"

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah






"I Should Have Known Better"

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more








"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You"

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you








"Things We Said Today"

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today








"You Can't Do That"

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh
You can't do that

Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
Leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that

Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that, oh






album: "Help!" (1965)



"Ticket To Ride"

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by mean








"Yesterday"

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.






album: "Rubber Soul" (1965)


"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood






"Girl"

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl, girl, girl

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there,
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl, girl, girl








album: "Revolver" (1966)


"Yellow Submarine"

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine









"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newpaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes









"Magical Mystery Tour"

[Roll up! Roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!]

Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (And that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (To make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away

Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (We've got everything you need), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (Satisfaction guaranteed), roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is hoping to take you away
Hoping to take you away

Mystery trip

Aaaah... the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (And that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (To make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour

Coming to take you away
The magical mystery tour is dying to take you away
Dying to take you away, take you today








"I Am The Walrus"
("Magical Mystery Tour" Version)

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together

See how they run
Like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman (Ooh)
They are the eggmen, (Ooh)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mister city p'liceman sitting pretty
Little p'licemen in a row
See how they fly
Like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Boy you been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman (Ooh)
They are the eggmen (Ooh)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English
Garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob g' goo goo g' joob

Expert texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile
Like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
I'm crying

Semolina pilchards
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Element'ry penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe







"Strawberry Fields Forever"

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree









"Penny Lane"

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange






"Revolution 1"

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out in
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead










"Maxwell's Silver Hammer"

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind









"Let It Be"
("Let It Be" Version)

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

"King Kong Song"

Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock'n roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it

And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

"Mamma Mia"

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know,
My my, I could never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh








"S. O. S."

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so goodbye







"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do"

Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cos it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and seeds







"Rock me"

Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now
(Don't stop the rocking, don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking)

Wanna be wanna be in my baby's arms
Gonna be gonna be
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours for ever, honey, that's what I
Wanna be wanna be wanna be, yeah








"Tiger"

The city is a jungle. You'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison. You'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
And if I meet you
*** What if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
Tiger!
(Tiger!)
Tiger!





"Thank You For The Music"

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me



"I Have A Dream"

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream



"Does Your Mother Know"

You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl you're only a child

Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)
But girl you're only a child




"Chiquitita"

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita




"The Piper"

They came from the hills
And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain
Came to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon...
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
Sub luna saltamus

They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon...
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
Sub luna saltamus

He gave them a dream
He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon...
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon



"The Visitors"

I hear the door-bell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me...

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling...

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me...
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)




"Slipping Through My Fingers"

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

[Verse 1]
Are you scared to walk through the hallways?
Are you worried that the spiders run away?
Are you petrified of being petrified?
Are we going to have to save the school again?

[Chorus]
We've got to save Ginny Weasley from the Basilisk
We've got to save the school from that unseen horror
We've got to save Ginny Weasley from the Basilisk
We've got to save the school again

[Verse 2]
It's been freaking out all the kids
It even took out Miss Norris
Ate up the film in Colin's camera
And petrified our friend Hermione Granger

We went to the
Coffee tea shop
On our first date
And it started off great

We made with the talking
And it was just fine
But it soon turned in
To that awkward silence
And I didn't know what to do next

So we sat there with all the couples kissing
And soon, things began deteriorating
And you began turning into
The human hosepipe

And then the next thing i knew
You were storming out
Just leaving me wondering

What have I done?
I don't care
Where you and Cedric were snogging
Cho Chang
What have I done?
I just want to replay
This valentines day

Well maybe I shouldn't
Have mentioned Hermione
And maybe you shouldn't
Have brought Cedric Diggory

Because I'd rather not talk about
Your dead ex-boyfriends over coffee
And why'd you have to bring up
Roger Davies
When he's sitting right there with his tea
'Cause if you wanted to go out with Roger Davies
How come you're here with me

Cho Chang
What have I done?
I don't care
Where you and Cedric were snogging
Cho Chang
What have I done?
I just want to replay

What have I done?
I don't wanna hear about, you know what I don't wanna hear about
You and Roger Davies

Things have gotten bad between me and you
So Cho Chang
I think were through

Album Harry and the Potters and the Power of Love

You're running scared, you have to hide
'cause you have nothing warm inside
The lives you lead have been so empty
No no I don't care about your money
Or you power-hungry ideology
No no, not me (no, no!)
We aren't scared of your masks or your cloaks
'cause we are wizards
And our hearts are filled with hope

We curses flying around
We'll stand firm and hold our ground
Our friends, they will fight with us
'till you say bitter end
But we say better end

...



And the damage you've done, we will mend it
The world can still be beautiful
And we will defend
For we are friends
And friendship you can't kill!


...




You're all too scared or proud to admit
That you made a mistake
Now you're on the wrong team
And you're doing whatever it takes
To be the Dark Lord's right hand man
Though you know he's just going to use your hand
In some dark potion's cauldron
And that will be your end
Wouldn't you rather have a friend?

Dear Tom

This song is by Ginny And The Weasleys.
Dear Tom, I got a story and I hope that you will listen
My brothers have been teasing me real bad
My robes are torn and tattered, and my books are old and battered
I know you'll understand why I'm so sad

I write and tell you every day, the troubles that have come my way
You always know just what to say, dear Tom
I never had a friend like you, to tell my woes and worries to
You really are a dream come true, dear Tom

Dear Tom, there is a boy I like, his name is Harry Potter
He's good and kind and funny and so sweet
The problem is, he's famous and always with Ron, Dean, Neville and Seamus
I don't think he'll ever notice me

I write and tell you every day, the troubles that have come my way
You always know just what to say, dear Tom
I never had a friend like you, to tell my woes and worries to
You really are a dream come true, dear Tom

Dear Tom, I can't remember where I was on Halloween
I saw Mrs. Norris hanging on the wall
I woke up in my bed and my robes were all blood red
Where the feathers came from, I can't tell at all

I write and tell you every day, the troubles that have come my way
You always know just what to say, dear Tom
I never had a friend like you, to tell my woes and worries to
You really are a dream come true, dear Tom

Dear Tom, I'm going mad and my brother, he suspects me
He says I'm looking pale and out of sorts
Dear Tom, my invisible stranger, did I attack Hermione Granger?
Now they're talking about closing down Hogwarts

I write and tell you every day, the troubles that have come my way
You always know just what to say, dear Tom
I never had a friend like you, to tell my woes and worries to
You really are a dream come true, dear Tom

Christmas At Hogwarts

This song is by Ginny And The Weasleys.
For the perfect Christmas, where would you be?
Would you choose to spend Christmas with me?
In a magical place all covered in snow
Are you coming, will you go?
To a mystical castle, set apart
The wonders you see there will gladden your heart
For a Christmas adventure come with me
To Hogwarts School, to Hogwarts School
Of Witchcraft and Wizardry

Ah, it's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah

The Great Hall is looking festive tonight
Twelve trees sparkling with real fairy light
The mistletoe garlands look a little faded
I do hope Nargles haven't invaded

The house ghosts are dressed in fine apparel
A suit of armour sang a Christmas carol
Just look at the Fat Lady's fancy dress
I wonder who she's trying to impress

Yeah! It's Christmas, ah
It's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
No you can't beat Christmas at Hogwarts

One year we had a great big snowball fight
We played outside in the fading light
Snow was thick on the castle grounds
Fred and George started messing around

They made a snowball and sent it straight at me
I threw it back but it missed and hit Harry
He didn't seem to mind one little bit
I think he secretly quite enjoyed it

Yeah! It's Christmas, ah
It's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
No you can't beat Christmas at Hogwarts

I'm having such fun this Christmas day
I wish it could last forever
And I know just why I'm feeling this way
'Cause the company couldn't be better

It's Christmas, ah
It's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
No you can't beat Christmas at Hogwarts

The feast is prepared by the house-elves
Hagrid drank two crates of eggnog by himself
A hundred turkeys and fat chipolatas
A hundred flaming Christmas puddings for afters

We spent the day enjoying our Christmas gifts
And all sang a round of 'God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs'
Everyone's cheerful, relaxed and merry
I just love spending Christmas with Harry

Yeah! It's Christmas, ah
It's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
No you can't beat Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
It's Christmas at Hogwarts, ah
No you can't beat Christmas at Hogwarts
(Merry Christmas Harry)

Intro 	Thanks to Elmo, for having helped me prove to myself that Hack at the Opera hadn't left me filked out. It's entirely apt that this has cost me two nights' sleep, and still counting.
OS California

In a dark deserted office
    Alone and open-plan
Strong smells of black coffee
    Percolating through my fan
Took a look at my user
    He would give a zombie fright
Though his eyes grew heavy and his head grew dim
    Still he had to hack through the night

There she sat on her CD
    A nymph beside her well
I wondered if it mattered
    If I were Compaq or if I were Dell
Then she fondled my chipset
    And pulled my plug-and-play
As she reconfigured my Ether card
    I heard my speaker say

Welcome to the OS California
    What a change of pace
    What an interface
Plenty of apps for the OS California
    Pay without a fear
    They will all be here

Her kernel's so Tiffany twisted
    I get the Mercedes bends
When she runs lots of pretty pretty apps
    From all her friends
How they dance in my low core
    Oh how I sweat
Desp'rate to remember
    Desp'rate to forget

So my man phoned his Mac friend
    Who laughed at him down the line
And said, That interface was two years old
    In nineteen eighty-nine
Still those adverts assault me
    From far away
E-mail-bombed in the middle of the night
    Just to have me say

Welcome to the OS California
    What a change of pace
    What an interface
Here's a new patch for the OS California
    What a nice surprise
    It's an ali-buy

A hall of memory mirrors
    Pretend protected mode
She said, We are all prisoners here
    Of two decades' code
And in the master journals
    They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their stern reviews
    But they still can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
    There were discs all over the floor
He was hacking for his life to get me
    As I was before
Hard luck, said my BIOS
    We are programmed to deceive
You can reboot as hard as you like
    But you can never leave

Original song 	Hotel California
Original artist 	The Eagles
Filk author 	Brian Marshall
Intro 	Written in 1987 while I was attending the University of Waterloo. This one was written the week after "Write in C".
Satan C Compiler
First I tore off the wrapping, Then I took out the Disk.
I never noticed the warning, Or the label that said "RISK!"

Then I picked up the licence, And read the Guarantee,
It said that all the code I'd write, Would be fully bug-free.

I put the disk onto drive A, the hard disk started to smoke
The smell of sulfur was everywhere, my eyes burned,I started to choke.

And then my amber monitor started glowing dark green,
and smoke rose as I saw the startup Screen.

And it said, Welcome to the SATAN C Compiler...
You'll write perfect code, it'll always load,,
We're so glad you bought the SATAN C Compiler,Bug Free's the Goal,
It'll only cost your soul....

I just stared at the terminal, I think it stared back at me,
Then I laughed at the practical joke, and settled down to use this C.

I wrote a HUGE multitasking Database just for fun,
With built in datebook and spreadsheet to boot
I never thought it would run...

I knew I'd left pointers dangling, coerced types every place,
My memory management problems with alloc
Not even lint could erase.

But I put in stub modules and prepared for the test,
It compiled in half a second flat, God was I impressed!

All the modules were working, Even the stubs were armed,
I knew right then and there my coding was great,
And my life must be charmed.

Welcome to the SATAN C Compiler,
you'll always write perfect code,
It'll always load,
But now you must pay for the SATAN C Compiler,
Although it works just swell, It'll never sell!

And now I sit in my Basement, Starving, Broke, and Alone,
I never speak to anyone, Although I sometimes moan.

But I Thought that I should warn you don't touch that disk,
The One that Infernal Business Machines Labels with 'RISK!'

But for me it's too late, I can't get out of this Hell,
I stab at ctrl-alt-del. But I just can't Kill the Shell.
All I get is one message. And The text makes me grieve.
"You can Logoff any time you like but you can never leave.."

Welcome to the SATAN C Compiler,
you'll always write perfect code,
It'll always load.
You better not go near the SATAN C Compiler.
If you do, my friend, It'll be your end....

Intro 	I remember getting a collection of computer songs of yours a while ago. Here's a song 3 of us made up recently in light of the recent lawsuit between AT&T and BSDI, as well as the shift by Sun (and others) away from Good Ol' BSD towards System V.
Berkeley California
(Sung to the tune "Hotel California" by the Eagles)

In a dark dim machine room
Cool A/C in my hair
Warm smell of silicon
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a Solarian(tm) light
My kernel grew heavy, and my disk grew slim
I had to halt(8) for the night
The backup spun in the tape drive
I heard a terminal bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be BSD or USL
Then they started a lawsuit
And they showed me the way
There were salesmen down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to Berkeley California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place (backgrounded)
Such a lovely trace(1)
Plenty of jobs at Berkeley California
Any time of year
Any time of year (backgrounded)
You can find one here
You can find one here

Their code was definately twisted
But they've got the stock market trends
They've got a lot of pretty, pretty lawyers
That they call friends
How they dance in the courtroom
See BSDI sweat
Some sue to remember
Some sue to forget
So I called up Kernighan
Please bring me ctime(3)
He said
We haven't had that tm_year since 1969
And still those functions are calling from far away
Wake up Jobs in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to Berkeley California
Such a lovely Place
Such a lovely Place (backgrounded)
Such a lovely trace(1)
They're livin' it up suing Berkeley California
What a nice surprise
What a nice surprise (backgrounded)
Bring your alibies

Windows NT a dreaming
Pink OS on ice
And they said
We are all just prisoners here
Of a marketing device
And in the judges's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They diff(1)'d the source code listings
But they can't kill -9 the beast
Last thing I remember
I was restore(8)'ing | more(1)
I had to find the soft link back to the path I was before
sleep(3) said the pagedaemon
We are programmed to recv(2)
You can swap out any time you like
But you can never leave(1)

Intro 	I just had to send it in, fellas. I'm sorry. I could not let all that stuff go by and not send it in.
Gateway To Heaven
There's a lady who knows
All the systems and nodes
And she's byteing a Gateway to Heaven
She telnets there, she knows
All the ports have been closed
With a nerd she can get
Files she came for

Woohoohoo
Woo Hoo Hoo HooHoo
And she's byteing a Gateway to Heaven
There's an motd
But she wants to be sure
Cos she knows sometimes hosts have
Two domains
In a path by the NIC
There's a burdvax that pings
Sometimes all of our flames
are cross-posted

Woohoohoo
Woo Hoo Hoo HooHoo
And she's byteing a Gateway to Heaven
And it's processed by root
Unix Labs will reboot
NCR will then listen to reason
And a prompt will respawn
For those yet to logon
And the networks will echo much faster

Woohoohoo
Woo Hoo Hoo HooHoo
And she's byteing a Gateway to Heaven
If there's a lookup in your netstat
don't be .alarmed now
it's just a pinging from the link queen
Yes there are two routes you can type in
but in the long run
there's still time to change the net you're on
(I hope so!)

And as we find stuff to download
We ftp and we chmod
There was a sysadm we know
Who changed the server to her own
She had root privs and she used chown
She hacked out on the DDN
And if you tail her stdin
Then you will find what you had lost
And get it back with cpio
To be a hack and not to scroll...

And she's byteing a Gateway to Heaven

Intro 	Here the beginning of "My Data are Over the Ocean", created during lunch by participants of the Young European Radio Astronomers Conference in September 1989 at Kharkov, (then) USSR. This was inspired by a colleague, who couldn't read back in Europe the tape with observational data she had written at an Hawaiian observatory. The other parts of the song weren't related to computers.
My Data are Over the Ocean
(to the tune of "My bonnie is over the ocean")

My data are over the ocean,
and I cannot read them right here.
My data are over the ocean,
oh bring back my data to me.

oh bring back my data to me, to me!
Bring back,

oh bring back my data to me!
